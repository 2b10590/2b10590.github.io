Complete freedom of choice comes from capitalism. Nothing is handed to you and everything is earned. Your value comes from yourself and how valuable you want to make yourself.

## The Good
Capitalism saves lives. yes it is no secret that the American health system has many problems and could use some needed reforms but we all know that if you arrive at ay hospitals emergency rooms you will receive medical help within 1 hour or more often less yes the cost of this is quite high but luckily hospitals offer payment plans to it patients that can not afford to pay upfront. 
## The Bad 
now compared to socialist contrys witch have free health care emergency room visits often have a wait time of 32 hours this cost lives and I know this first hand I know of a case where a child cracked their head wide open and who died waiting to be admittedin in Canada.
## And The Ugly
capitalism may not give you free stuff like socialist countries but you can be dame sure that it gives you freedom of choice.
