title:  Capitalism is a gift
---

Talk about capitalismâ€™s moral superiority the next time you hear someone parroting the politicians, entertainers, academics, clerics, and professional rabble rousers who are all bemoaning the failures of capitalism.  Their only answers are to dust off the same old prescriptions that have been tried, tested, and found wanting again and again.

1) Capitalsm Gives us Freedom
The most basic freedom is the freedom of choices.  Capitalism promotes choice,  It promotes the ability for people to decide what they want to buy, how much they want to buy, where they want to live, where they want to work, and so on.  With socialism (Cummunism), choices are limited.  The government decides, for example, what kind of light bulb is available, how much water a toilet can use, the minimum factory efficiency of an air conditioning system, and more. This can be seen prominently in California  a heavily democratic leaning state with "democratic socialism" where water use is regulated. 

The removal of simple choices reduces freedom.  The removal of all choices is slavery.  The direction of socialism is towards slavery.  The direction of capitalism is towards freedom.  Capitalism is morally superior.
